# TOPSIS Calculator

This project is a simple TOPSIS-based decision support tool that allows users to upload a dataset, specify criteria weights and impacts, and compute rankings using the TOPSIS method.

The application focuses on user input and processing, while the results are generated and saved as an output file.

## 📌 Features

- CSV file upload support  
- Input of criteria weights (comma-separated)  
- Input of criteria impacts (`+` for benefit, `-` for cost)  
- Backend computation using the TOPSIS algorithm  
- Result generation in CSV format  

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. User uploads the CSV file  
2. User enters weights and impacts  
3. Data is processed using the TOPSIS method  
4. Scores and ranks are calculated internally  
5. Output is generated as a result file
